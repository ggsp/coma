## 1. Vision and Product Narrative

**Goal:**
Build a **digital platform** where researchers, funding bodies, and the public can explore past and ongoing research projects, see where funds went, and engage in topic-based communities to improve collaboration and funding allocation decisions.

**Tagline:**

> ‚ÄúDiscover what has been researched, funded, and learned ‚Äî and connect with the people behind it.‚Äù

**Unique Value Proposition:**
Combine **research transparency** (data, metrics, impact) with **community engagement** (collaboration, discussion, recommendations).

## 10. KPIs and Validation Metrics

| Category     | Metric                                  | Target |

## 11. Open Technical Questions

1. Should project metadata originate from **existing public APIs** (e.g., OpenAIRE, CORDIS) or **manual CSV import** for MVP?
2. Should semantic search be **powered via Azure OpenAI** (embeddings) from MVP or added later?
3. Should we include **data validation workflows** (funders verifying projects) now or post-MVP?
4. Is user-generated project creation allowed or admin-only?

---

## 12. Deliverable Summary (for MVP Demo)

* **Deployed web app (PWA)** with 3 role types and seed data
* **Project Explorer** with search & filter
* **Profile pages** for researchers and funders
* **Community discussions** per topic
* **Dashboard with key metrics**
* **Admin console** for data import and moderation
* **Documentation** (README, ADR, ERD, API Spec)
