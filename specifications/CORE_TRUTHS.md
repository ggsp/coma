# Initial description of problem

We want to build a platform for a research community to connect and make the exploration process of previously completed research and previously distributed funds more transparent, with the target of better assigning funding in the future. The stakeholders are the researchers themselves, as well as funding body employees, who are in charge of distributing the funds.

# Assumptions

- It is not just about tracking completed research and funding, it is also about building community
